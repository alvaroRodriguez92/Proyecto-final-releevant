# Proyecto-final-releevant

This is the final project we did for Releevant. The idea was to make a directory of companys, grouped in different sectors and categorys. As user you could check all this companys and use the features of the platform, such as a chatbot, the map we implemented with leaflet, etc.

1- First you need to import the BBDD to your mysql workbench or similar program.
2- Second, go to the folder "backend" and make sure that the ".env" file has the correct credentials to make the connection to the BBDD.
3- Third, in the folder backend add "npm run start" command and in the folder frontend "npm run dev" command.
4- Last, just go to the localhost in your browser and enjoy our project! http://localhost:5173/
