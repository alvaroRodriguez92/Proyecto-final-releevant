# Proyecto-final-releevant

This is the final project we did for Releevant. The idea was to make a directory of companys, grouped in different sectors and categorys. As user you could check all this companys and use the features of the platform, such as a chatbot, the map we implemented with leaflet, etc.

1. First you need to import the BBDD to your mysql workbench or similar program.
2. Second, go to the folder "backend" and make sure that the ".env" file has the correct credentials to make the connection to the BBDD.
3. Third, open the terminal in the folder backend, add `npm install` and then `npm run start` command to start the server. 
4. Open another terminal in the folder frontend, add `npm install` as well for install the dependencies and then `npm run dev` command to init the proyect.
5. Last, just go to the localhost in your browser and enjoy our project! http://localhost:5173/
